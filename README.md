# Social Network Analysis & Mapping in Python with NetworkX
we  are going to analyze the Facebook social network by using a tool called NetworkX and Matplotlib on python. NetworkX is a graph theory and complex network modeling tool developed in Python language. It has built-in commonly used graphs and complex network analysis algorithms, which can facilitate complex network data analysis, simulation modeling, etc.
We will use a SNAP public dataset Social circles: Facebook from Stanford University(https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html). This dataset consists of ‘circles’ (or ‘friends lists’) from Facebook. Facebook data was collected from survey participants. The dataset includes node features (profiles), circles, and ego networks. 
A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes. In this Facebook friends circle dataset, the nodes means each of the Facebook accounts. And the edges means the connections between each of the account. For example, A has 200 different friends on his Facebook, this Node A will have 200 different edges. This dataset contains 4039 nodes and 88234 edges.
