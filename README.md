the dataset used is a "Social circles: Facebook" from Stanford University(https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html). This dataset consists of 'circles' (or 'friends lists') from Facebook. Facebook data was collected from survey participants using this Facebook app. The dataset includes node features (profiles), circles, and ego networks.
